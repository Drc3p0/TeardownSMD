## Teardown SMD Challenge

With the rise of the [SMD challenge boards](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/18/a-newbie-takes-the-smd-challenge-at-supercon/), we thought that the layout would work perfectly with our "90's abandoned mall" vaporwave design for [Teardown 2024](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024)! Thanks to the support from [OshPark](https://oshpark.com/), [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/) and [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/), we bring you the *Teardown 2024 SMD Challenge*. 

This hexagonal PCB comes in two flavors: *Courtesy* edition and *Cursed* edition.  The *Courtesy* edition uses pads meant for hand-soldering, which with the size going down to 0201, it's plenty challenging on its own! But if that's not enough, the *Cursed* edition has smaller SMD pads for those who want an even more impossible challenge. 

This SMD challenge layout and concept came from the famous design by [MakersBox](https://www.tindie.com/stores/makersbox/).  Support their work by buying one of their OG SMD Challenge boards [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/smd-challenge/)!

### Tools Needed:
Fine-tip soldering iron
Solder
Plenty o' flux
Fine-tip tweezers
Probably a magnifying device of some kind
Spare dose of sanity (or lack thereof)

We would say use a hot plate or heat gun, but that takes too much of the challenge out of it ;)

You may need to look at the Datasheets to see what the correct orientation of the LEDs looks like.. 
Refer to the [Components list](https://github.com/Drc3p0/TeardownSMD/blob/main/Components.md) for links. 

New to SMD soldering?  You'll want to practice on something much more reasonable than this design. Check out this video to better understand what you're getting yourself into..

Code for the Attiny is the same as the OG SMD Challenge boards:
